# Java Stream API Exploration

This project is a simple Java application that explores the functionalities of the Java Stream API.

## Features

1. **Filtering and Collecting**: The application demonstrates how to filter a list of integers to get only the even numbers, both with a traditional for loop and with the Stream API.

2. **Finding Elements**: It shows how to find a specific element in a list of strings using the Stream API.

3. **Mapping and Collecting**: The application creates a list of `Fruit` objects, each with a name, category, and price. It then uses the Stream API to create a new list containing only the prices of the fruits.

4. **Mapping and Discounting**: It demonstrates how to apply a function to each element in a stream to create a new stream. In this case, it applies a 20% discount to the price of each fruit.

5. **Skipping and Limiting**: The application shows how to use the `skip` and `limit` operations to manipulate the size of the stream.

6. **Sorting**: Finally, it sorts the list of fruits in order from highest to lowest price.

## Running the Code

To run the code, simply execute the `Main` class. The results of each operation will be printed to the console.

## Conclusion

This project provides a clear and concise introduction to the Java Stream API, demonstrating its power and flexibility for manipulating collections of data. It serves as a great starting point for anyone looking to understand and utilize this feature of Java.
